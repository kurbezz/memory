# Agent Memory

Long-term memory lives in `./.memory/` as plain markdown. Three levels:

- `./.memory/project/` — this project only
- `./.memory/groups/<group>/` — shared by a group of projects (zero or more groups)
- `./.memory/workspace/` — the whole working environment (user preferences, tools, setup)

No `.memory/` directory → this project has no memory set up. Work without it;
you may suggest `memory init <workspace>` to the user, but never run it
yourself. Likewise suggest, never run, `memory link-group <group>`: joining a
group is the user's decision.

## The `memory` CLI

The CLI ships with this skill: `bin/memory` next to this file. Use `memory`
from PATH if installed; otherwise call the bundled script by its path
(`<this skill's directory>/bin/memory`). It handles mechanics only — setting
up `.memory/` (`init`), linking groups (`link-group`/`unlink-group`),
consistency checks (`doctor`), memory consolidation (`dream --report` is a
read-only whole-store report of duplicates, stale facts and drift; `dream`
runs the cleanup unattended), OpenCode plugin installation
(`install-opencode`), and store backup (`backup`). `backup` commits with a
structured message derived from the staged diff (e.g.
`memory(<project>): add <slug>, ...` or `memory: add N in S scopes` with a
per-scope body) — nothing to configure, it just describes what changed.
Reading and writing facts is always plain file I/O, no CLI needed.

The CLI requires Bash, `git`, `grep`, `awk`, `readlink`, and filesystem
symlink support; it has no server, database, or package-runtime dependency.

## Reading

At the start of work, read every `INDEX.md` that exists:
`./.memory/project/INDEX.md`, `./.memory/groups/*/INDEX.md`,
`./.memory/workspace/INDEX.md`. They are one line per fact — cheap.

If an `<agent-memory>` block with these indexes is already in your context
(the OpenCode plugin injects it into the prompt), do not read the
`INDEX.md` files again — go straight to the relevant fact files.

Open a fact's file only when its description is relevant to the task at hand.
As work touches a topic listed in an index, read that fact before acting.

Search tools do not see memory. `.memory/*` are symlinks and `.memory/` is in
the global gitignore, so `rg`, `grep -r`, and agent Grep/Glob tools return
nothing from it even when the text is there. Always read `INDEX.md` files by
path. For a full-text search use `memory grep <term>` (bundled CLI), or
`rg -L --no-ignore <term> .memory/` when the CLI is not available. `memory
status` shows which levels and groups this project has.

## Writing

Record a fact when you learn something that is (a) not derivable from the code
or git history and (b) useful in future sessions. Do not store what the repo
already documents.

Pick the level by who will benefit:

- only this codebase → `project/`
- several projects of a group (shared infra, shared APIs, team agreements) →
  `groups/<group>/`; with several groups linked, pick the one whose scope
  matches the fact
- the user or the whole environment (preferences, tools, machine setup) →
  `workspace/`

When a fact spans several linked projects, put the shared part in the group
and keep only the project-specific details (app names, endpoints, IDs) in the
project fact — do not repeat the shared block in every project. If two levels
disagree, the more specific level wins: project > group > workspace.

Never store secrets: tokens, passwords, connection strings with credentials,
or URLs that embed them. The store is a git repository that may be pushed.

Keep `description` under ~120 characters. Every description is loaded into
context at the start of every session, so long descriptions are paid for on
each run.

Before writing, scan that level's INDEX.md for an existing fact on the same
topic — update its file instead of creating a duplicate. Delete or fix facts
you discover to be stale.

### Fact format

One fact per file. File name: kebab-case slug, `[a-z0-9-]` only, `.md`.

```markdown
---
description: pgbouncer connection pool breaks above 50 connections
type: gotcha
created: 2026-07-07
updated: 2026-09-04
---

Above 50 connections, pgbouncer in transaction mode starts returning
stale prepared statements. Workaround: ...
```

`type` is one of: `gotcha` (footgun), `decision` (choice made and why),
`convention` (we do it this way), `context` (goals, constraints),
`reference` (links to dashboards, tickets, docs).

`updated` is optional: set it (today's date) whenever you change the body, so
a reader can tell how fresh the fact is. Keep `description` under ~120
characters — it is what every session loads.

Link related facts with `[[file-name]]` wiki links (cross-level allowed).

### After every write

Run `memory index` (the bundled CLI) — it rebuilds every `INDEX.md` from the
facts' frontmatter. If you cannot run commands, add or update the fact's line
in that level's `INDEX.md` by hand:

```markdown
- [pgbouncer-connection-limit](pgbouncer-connection-limit.md) — gotcha: pool breaks above 50 connections
```

(A plain `-` instead of `—` is accepted.) `memory doctor` reports drift
between indexes and files, and warns about over-long descriptions and
`[[links]]` that point nowhere.

### Housekeeping

When an index grows past ~40 lines, or you notice near-duplicate or stale
entries, use the `memory-dream` skill for this project, or suggest
`memory dream` (whole store, unattended) to the user. Task status ("still needs
staging validation") does not belong in memory — record the decision or gotcha
it produced, or nothing.
